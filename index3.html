    <h2>There are so  many great things about cats! I have a bunch of favorites as well! They are my little precious kitties! I've always loved cats! My persona and pfp's for many things are cats! I think it stemmed from an argument I had with a friend back in 6th grade. She loved dogs, but I didn't really agree much with the great things about dogs she was spouting. After that spat, I started researching all the great things about cats and realized how much I loved them! Now, I am obsessed! I have a bunch of pfp's that I cycle through, my phone wallpaper has cats in it, I even have cats in my room (like everywhere!!!). I defend them a lot as well, especially in front of my parents and a lot of my friends who loves dogs. I want to get one when I'm older and have a place of my own as my parents are allergic to them. I kinda think they are lying, but who cares. I'll live!</h2>
